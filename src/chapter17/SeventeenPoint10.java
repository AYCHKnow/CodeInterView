	/* Skipped: Horribly explained. Question is 10 years old and uses XML. Tricks:
	 * - Must use tree-like recursion since "Elements" may contain other "Elements" as children
	 * - Use StringBuffer since we're piecing together a String
	 * - Code made a good assumption for coding purposes: That on "Element root" we can say root.getNameCode() or root.atributes or attr.getTagCode()
