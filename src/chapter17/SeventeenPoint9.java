	/* So simple that I didn't code it:
	 * - Solution 1 - If only need to query it once, just do a linear search through the String [] (which is very likely unsorted)
	 * - Solution 2 - Just create a HashMap<String, Integer> for the counts of the words so that lookup is O(1);
	 * - book used .trim(), which is a String method, to remove leading and trailing whitespace
