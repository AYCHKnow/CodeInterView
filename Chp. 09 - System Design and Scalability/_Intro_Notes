Introduction
 
	4 ways to divide data (Read book's explanation for great tips)
		- by order of appearance (Benefit: won't ever need more machines than necessary)
		- by hashing it mod number of machines (Benefit: Every machine knows exactly where data is)
		- by using what the actual values represent. Can group similar things together, like all people in Mexico.
		- arbitrarily (Benefit: better load balancing)
	
	"Find words in millions of documents"
		- preprocess the data with a HashMap<String, ArrayList<Document>>
		- Somehow divide the HashMap across machines. Can do it alphabetically by keywords.
